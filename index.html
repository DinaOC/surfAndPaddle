  <h3>Name history</h3>
  <p>
    The city was named in compliance with the Greek Plan of Catherine the Great. It was named after the ancient Greek city of Odessos (Ὀδησσός), which was mistakenly believed to have been located here. Although Odessa is located in between the ancient Greek cities of Tyras (Τύρας) and Olbia (Ὀλβία), Odessos is believed to be the predecessor of the present day city of Varna, Bulgaria.[4]

  Catherine's secretary of state (кабинет-секретарь) Adrian Gribovsky (ru) claimed in his memoirs that the name was his suggestion. Some expressed doubts about this claim, while others noted the reputation of Gribovsky as an honest and modest man.[5]
